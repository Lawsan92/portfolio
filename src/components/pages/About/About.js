            ​​I’m a language-agnostic full-stack engineer who specializes in Python/Django and JavaScript/Node.js/React workflows and ecosystems. I currently reside in Austin, TX, but I'm originally from Rome, Italy, and have grown up in various areas of the United States, as well as spent a few years in France. I also speak fluent Italian and have a conversational knowledge of French.<br/><br/>
            My journey began 4 years ago with small-scale independent freelance projects, eventually transitioning into full-stack web development. I later moved on to a Bilingual (in Italian) technical support role for a WiFi-based camera security system, which taught me the importance of clean system design and efficient troubleshooting. During this period, I also acted as a technical writer for internal SOPs and as an interview consultant, helping hiring managers evaluate candidate fluency in Italian.<br/><br/>
            I eventually obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from WGU, where I deepened my understanding of algorithms, data structures, computing performance, operating systems, threading, and large-scale application design. While at WGU, I also had the opportunity to expand my horizons into other tech subjects and fields, such as Java programming, C programming, discrete Mathematics, database administration, IT business practices, Software Quality Assurance, SDLC paradigms and models, Linux Foundations, Machine Learning, and more. <br/><br/>
