      <p>Hi, I'm Lawrence. I'm a fullstack javascript engineer with a specialty in MERN and PERN tech stacks. I'm an avid problem solver and love creating new content. After getting an Associate's in Music, I decided to undertake a carrer change into tech and found myself enrolled in Hack Reactor. After graduating, I'm now a fully capable full stack engineer and am readyy to take on any challenge. I currently live in Austin but I'm originally from Rome and have spent time all over the United States, as well as a few years in France. My hobbies include: playing guitar, singing, writing songs, working on personal apps and projects and running. Open to work.</p>
